Your task is to fully debug, fix, and implement all broken features in my web project.
Currently, the system has many demo placeholders, unresponsive buttons, and missing functionalities.
I want you to remove all demo data, replace with working logic, and make the system production-ready.

ðŸ”§ Issues & Fixes (Detailed)
1. Automation Page

Issue: Page not functioning; multiple buttons unresponsive.

Fix:

Debug all button click handlers.

Ensure each automation feature executes its logic (not demo placeholders).

Replace "demo starting" with real execution logic.

2. Login System (Instagram Integration)

Issue:

Cannot log into Instagram account.

Input fields for credentials look like a demo, not functional.

Fix:

Implement real Instagram login using API / OAuth / instagrapi or other library.

Ensure user can securely enter username and password.

Remove all demo login placeholders.

Store credentials securely (encrypted or via session, not plain text).

3. Analytics Page

Issue: Analytics page broken â†’ 404 error.

Fix:

Restore proper routing and backend endpoint for analytics.

Connect to real analytics data source.

Display user activity, engagement, growth charts, etc.

4. Telegram Bot Integration

Issue: Bot not connecting even though valid token is provided in .env.

Fix:

Check .env variable loading logic.

Debug bot initialization code.

Ensure bot authenticates and connects to Telegram API.

Test commands and confirm real responses (not demo).

5. System Health Page

Issue: Showing only demo system metrics.

Fix:

Connect to real server/system health monitoring (CPU, RAM, uptime, errors).

Display live data instead of hardcoded values.

6. Demo Features

Issue: Many features are demo placeholders (demo data, demo start, demo login).

Fix:

Identify and remove all demo code.

Replace with real logic, APIs, and working modules.

7. User Management Page

Issue: Page gives 404 error.

Fix:

Implement proper user management system (CRUD â€“ create, read, update, delete).

Ensure admin can manage users (add, block, edit roles).

Fix page routing and backend API.

8. Quick Actions

Issue: None of the quick action buttons work.

Fix:

Debug frontend click events.

Link buttons to real backend functions.

Test each action for correct execution.

9. Follow / Story / Other Modules

Issue: All modules show demo state like "demo starting", not real execution.

Fix:

Connect Follow Module to real Instagram automation logic.

Fix Story Module to fetch and interact with stories properly.

Ensure other modules (likes, comments, etc.) work with real accounts.

10. Activity Logs Page

Issue: Page broken â†’ 404 error.

Fix:

Implement real activity logging system.

Store actions in database (follows, likes, logins, etc.).

Display logs on page with filters (date/user/action).

11. Overall System Fix & Stabilization

Issue: Web project is unstable with many errors across multiple pages.

Fix:

Perform full code review & debugging.

Fix routing errors, API connections, and data flow.

Ensure system is fully working end-to-end.

Remove all demo placeholders permanently.

âœ… Final Deliverables

No 404 errors on any page.

All buttons, modules, and features fully functional.

Instagram login & automation working.
